A class defines a blueprint for an object. We use the same syntax to declare objects of a class as we use to declare variables of other basic types. For example:  Box box1;          // Declares variable box1 of type Box Box box2;          // Declare variable box2 of type Box Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school.

An int calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's scores. Input Format  Most of the input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor.
